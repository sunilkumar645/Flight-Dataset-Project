    "d. What is the total number of seats for the cancelled flights? If we assume the average flight price of $50, what is the total economis loss?<br>\n",

    "b. Is there a correlation between the weather datasets and daily average arrival delay? Justify your answer with a statistical model (hypothesis testing)<br>\n",
    "c. Is there a correlation between the Federal Holiday Schedule and daily average arrival delay?<br>\n",
    "d. Calculate the average arrival delay for all the flights for each arrival airport (e.g. IAD, DCA, and BWI) and determine most and least reliables (most reliable = the one that has the shortest average delay)<br>\n",

    "f. What day of the week we had the highest average delay?<br>\n",
    "g. Which one had a higher average delay: flights that took off in the morning (6 am to 10 am), noon (11 am to 2 pm), afternoon (3 pm to 5pm), or evening (6 pm to 10 pm)?<br>\n",
